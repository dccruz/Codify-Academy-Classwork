Exercise for Week 4<br>
	1. In HTML: Create 4 div tags. Each with a class of box and a second class name (each second class any color you want - we will set a background-color to each second class).
	ex: <div class="box red"></div>
	2. In CSS: Select the body tag and add text-align center as a property and value.<br>.
	3. In CSS: Select the class of box and add 3 properties display, height & width.<br> 
	4. In CSS: Select the second class of each div (they should be different class names) and add a background color to each selector each with a different color.<br>
	5. In CSS: Using media queries make it so that the 2nd and 3rd div tags disappear when you SHRINK the screen size below 600px.
